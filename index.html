          Iâ€™m a passionate Front-End Web Developer skilled in HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React. I create responsive,
          user-friendly websites with a focus on great design and smooth
          functionality. I enjoy turning ideas into interactive digital
          experiences and am always eager to learn new technologies.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <h1>I am from East Timor, </h1>
   <p>   a beautiful country in Southeast Asia. I arrived in
      the UK in December 2022, ready to start a new chapter in my life.
      Adjusting to a new country was both exciting and challenging, but I saw it
      as a great chance to grow. After arriving, I studied English at CCSW Crewe
      Campus through the ESOL course. This helped me improve my language skills
      and build my confidence. The supportive teachers and classmates made my
      transition much easier. In 2023, I began learning web development. I was
      fascinated by how websites are built and enjoyed learning HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript. Web development has opened up new possibilities for me and
      inspired me to keep learning and growing. I am proud of my progress since
      coming to the UK, and I look forward to continuing my education and making
      a positive difference in my community.</p>
